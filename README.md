There are a project with LoRa device to send and get temperature from vegetable warehouse to place (about 0.5km) where are internet. 
One "Heltec LoRa 32(name"A")" device get temperature from "TMP102" sensor and send it radio wave by 870000000Hz. Another simply LoRa device(name"B"),
connect to the internet and sends the geted info from sended device("A"). Temperature sensor I mount on the wall.![tmp102_on_wall](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cab93b3d-d84b-4032-8aa8-edb811d2b2b8) I connect it  to device"A", and send data to Device"B"
![sender(Device A)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bf192d5-4f58-49f6-b724-ace5829685b5) Device "A" sends the counter value, which increase every 4th seconds and sends temperature value. I do this, that I see , if "TMP102" is bad and not sending data.
Device "B" shows the geted temperature from Device"A", and the IP (if there is a internet conection) ![Device B screen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b0dd6f3-f870-4823-9edf-1fa99c7bedcb) The wiev in "google maps":


![LoRa Distance](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e433588a-a164-4bc7-9bfa-092176bbc3b9), after few days we look on IP adress which we get from device"B".
